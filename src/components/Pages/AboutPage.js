            I Built this Cart Application to practice my React Skills and also the Speed of building user interfaces.
            It was really a Good Experience Practicing React. I have used Context API for managining states. 
            I have also implemented Login and Sign Up functionality using Google Firebase Authentication.

}

export default AboutPage
